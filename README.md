**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/albineb007/Hovertolight.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Code:**

   Open the project in your preferred code editor and examine the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to understand how the grid and hover effects are constructed.

3. **Customize:**

   - Modify the grid dimensions, colors, and animations within the CSS file (`styles.css`).
   - Experiment with creating different hover effects in the JavaScript file (`script.js`).

**Usage**

* **HTML Structure:**

   The core HTML file (`index.html`) houses the grid structure. Each individual grid box is represented by a `<div>` element.

* **CSS Styling:**

   The CSS file (`styles.css`) defines the grid layout and visual styles. You can customize colors, borders, and other visual properties here.  

* **JavaScript Interactivity:**

   The JavaScript file (`script.js`) manages hover events. Feel free to add your own logic to create captivating effects when users hover over the grid boxes.
